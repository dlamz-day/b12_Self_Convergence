# b12_Self_Convergence

This is the BISG scheme with pseudo ADPLL clock for checking the critical path delay (CPD) of  benchmark b12 from ITC'99.
Also with the self-convergence scheme, which is built to estimate how many number of test patterns are enough for the benchmark to gauge the CPD of it.

The RTL and Synthesis, APR and GDS file has already been generated.
